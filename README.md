# Bay Area Spanish

This repository extracts vowel formants from word list elicitations in the Corpus of Bay Area Spanish (CBAS) and from sentence elicitations in the DIMEx100 Corpus, in order to contrast the vowel space of Spanish in contact with California English (Bay Area Spanish) with that of Mexican Spanish. Productions are analyzed across stress and duration.
