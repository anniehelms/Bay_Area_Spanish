# Bay_Area_Spanish

This repository extracts vowel formants from word list elicitations in the Corpus of Bay Area Spanish (CBAS) and from elicitations in the DIMEx100 Corpus, in order to characterize the vowel space of Spanish in contact with California English. Productions are analyzed across linguistic environment, stress, and duration.
